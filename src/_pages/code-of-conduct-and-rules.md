## Code of Conduct
Welcome to Sabby Gallery! It is a requirement of entry that you read everything here before interacting, so please take the time to do so.

This Code of Conduct is open to adjustment by a quorum of members.

### Preamble
This Discord is a space for discussing projects, exhibitions, and topics related to Sabby Co-op games, arts, and activism.

#### The Sabby’s Space / space of Sabby is defined as:
The greater building that Sabby exists in and not just our tenancy.

### Community Expectations
This space is for people interested in creating, collaborating, and showing their work. It's for connecting with people to learn from, create with, and build up. A community working together for better things.

This space should be a safer place for everybody regardless of membership status, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size/shape, indigence, race, age, or religion.

These expectations extend to the physical space of Sabby but are not exclusive to it. Infractions of these guidelines even outside of Sabby’s physical and digital spaces may be still treated as infractions of our community guidelines and subject to the same consequences.

Members are responsible for the behavior of non-members that they allowed into the space during non-staffed times. Infractions against non-members you have allowed or enabled will be held against yourself and them.

#### Staffed Hours are defined as:
The duration of public events with one or more Volunteers assigned to hosting. For example, co-working from 12pm - 7pm would be considered staffed hours.
A volunteer being present at all does not count as staffed hours. Volunteers are welcome to use the space without the assumed responsibilities of being a host beyond normal expectations of using the space.

### 🟢 As a member of this community, you are encouraged to:
- Collectively and individually be committed to inclusivity, helping create a safe learning and sharing space.
- Share your knowledge and resources for the benefit of all.
- Share non-Sabby events and projects in the discord. 
- Attend and support events while encouraging non-members to attend.

### 🟡 Infractions within this category will lead to a formal warning and possibly further consequences.
- Use of behaviour that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, non-binaryphobic, transphobic, ableist, indigence, and others—this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs, or insensitive or discriminatory jokes, or symbols.
- Using generative AI in any form (as distinct from other uses of neural networks, such as in medical research). 
- Not returning borrowed Sabby equipment for two weeks longer than the stated borrowing period. The typical borrowing period is two weeks, but may vary if stated. If, three weeks after the initial warning, the item is still yet to be returned, then the infraction will be escalated to theft and you may be charged for its replacement. 
- Not keeping spaces clean and usable. This includes littering, graffiti, or failing to clean/tidy equipment after use.
- Allowing more than 3 non-members into the space during non-staffed hours. If you wish to bring more than 3 non-members into space, it’s recommended that you book it as a private event. That way Sabby can review and decide if that needs to be staffed by a volunteer and collect non-members info.
- Disrupting the space for others by one’s state, hygiene, or patterns of behaviour (i.e. turning up drunk or unwashed). Repeated infractions of this nature will be updated to a more serious infraction.

### 🔴 Infractions within this category will lead to immediate expulsion.
- Assaulting or other non-consensual touching of another person. 
- Stealing / theft, purposeful destruction or defacing of another person’s property, property of Sabby Co-op or that of others within Sabby’s space.
- Verbal or physical harassment, stalking, bullying, threatening, either in physical or digital spaces.
- Unauthorised blocking or otherwise prohibiting others access to Sabby spaces.

### Processes
If you are called out on something that was found offensive:
- Listen without interruption.
- Believe what they are saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
- Earnestly try and understand what is being said and why. 
- Ask for tips / help with avoiding the offence in the future.
- Apologise and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines carries consequences.
For minor infractions, you may be temporarily suspended from Sabby’s digital and physical spaces. For repeat, serious offences, you will be expelled from the Sabby Co-op and lose membership.

#### Expulsion is defined as:
Permanent removal from digital and physical spaces, as well as losing membership and no longer acting as part of the Sabby cooperative.

### Expulsion Protocol:
Potential expulsions will be raised during an open meeting or public discussion amongst members. If 70% of those in attendance are in agreement that there is sufficient evidence of the infraction then the offender will be expelled.
A volunteer will then reach out to the offending individual(s) and inform you of the infraction(s) committed. The expulsion will be enacted immediately and those involved will be banned from all Sabby related activities and spaces. 

Once expelled, the only exception to any involvement with Sabby will be an allowance to make an appeal to the expulsion at the next open meeting after the relevant parties have been informed of the expulsion. An appeal may only be made once. After this if appeal is denied, all interactions with Sabby including open meetings are banned as defined by expulsion.
