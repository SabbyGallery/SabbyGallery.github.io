*After Sabby re-opens we'll be running Table Flip every Thursday night.*

Table Flip! Board games! Card games (as a treat?)! "Anything but video" games!

Hang out after co-working ends every Thursday and play some board games or card games. Games and cards provided but feel free to BYO any games of your choosing.

Hosted by Magic: The Gathering enthusiast [Ellie](https://bsky.app/profile/toestee.itch.io)!
