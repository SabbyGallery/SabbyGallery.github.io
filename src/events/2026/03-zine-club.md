Moving to a monthly slot in 2026!

Put aside long complicated projects and come make a quick Zine in a few hours while hanging with cool folks! 

Join Tegan (https://teganewebb.neocities.org/) for another afternoon of zine-making.

Supplies are provided but feel free to BYO if you have extra stuff you want to use (and share!).
