This exhibition presents work from first year students doing the course Creative Practice 1 in the Bachelor of Design, Games at RMIT University.

Students have interviewed people of their Grandparents generation and made visual representations of their stories in the form of graphic novels or comics. Drawing on the stories of real people in diverse locations, the stories cover from the 1930â€™s to the present day. 
Selecting a theme common to their individual works, small groups have come together to discuss and understand what brings their stories together. Each group has then made an interactive digital and a physical work to present and represent the connections between the works and across the generations.
