Is your mind burdened by terrible knowledge? Or have your brains already rotted away? Whatever state your skull is in, get ready for Halloween Trivia! 
Hosted by Mads!

From 7:00pm - 9.30pm on Halloween (Oct 31st) come along to Sabby with all your most eldritch wisdoms, to find out who's the most Hallo-wise of all.

Ideally, this will be a team event, but this will depend on attendee numbers. Please mark yourself as attending on Discord if you're keen to help with planning.
