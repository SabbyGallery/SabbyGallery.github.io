For those not fmailiar with what a Game Jam is, it's a set amount of time where people will get together in to a team, make a game, and upload it for other participants to play.

Sometimes there is voting, prizes, mentors, judges, workshops in the lead up, or other opportunities. Sometimes jams are in person, usually they are online.

Ludum Dare, works that everyone leaves comments/feedback on eachother's games and votes for what elements of the game are outstanding. Then everyone gets a rank.

Ludum Dare has been going for years and years and years, and is known to be one of the more artier game jams, and one that a lot more older developers will participate in compared to others.
