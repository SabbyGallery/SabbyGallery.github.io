Come along for a chill and cosy afternoon of zine making at Sabbatical Gallery!  Seasoned zine maker Tegan (https://teganewebb.neocities.org/) will be around to show you some techniques and share zines from her collection for inspiration. It's gonna be fun! 

Materials will be provided, but feel free to BYO any art/craft supplies you'd like to use. There might even be a typewriter (if Richie can get it working, fingers crossed but no promises!).
