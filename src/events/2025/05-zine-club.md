The next zine club will be Saturday May 17th! ðŸŽ‰

Put aside long complicated projects and come make a quick Zine in a few hours while hanging with cool folks! 

Join Tegan (https://teganewebb.neocities.org/) for another afternoon of zine-making.

Supplies are provided but feel free to BYO if you have extra stuff you want to use (and share!).

Zine Club is looking at moving to a bi-monthly (once every two months) schedule for zine club going forward, as part of a push to make the running of Sabby more sustainable across Sabby volunteers.
