<sub><sup>Sabby is not affiliated with or responsible for Max International Games Weekend. Max International Games Weekend is not affliated with Melbourne International Games Week, Creative Victoria or any of the other organisations involved in Melbourne International Games Week. Any similarities with the MIGW logo are because it's an edit done in loving tribute to the most exhausting week of the Australian gamedev calendar.</sub></sup>
