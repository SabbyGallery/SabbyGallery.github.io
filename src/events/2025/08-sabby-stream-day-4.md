Hot Seat Game Jam! Participants will all be working collaboratively on a single game.

Roll a d20. That's how many minutes you have in the hot seat as we create one game with too many cooks. We need your skills whether you code, draw, make sounds or are a real ideas person.

Programming experience not needed, feel free to contribute by adding art, sounds, music or anything else!
