Following last year's packed [Gunpla Workshop](../../2024/11-gunpla-workshop) hosted by [Mika](https://bio.link/cafemeek) we're bringing you another evening of mech making!

Come learn to make some mech buds with your human buds! Only a few kits will be provided so please BYO your own kit.

Tools will be available for free but you're welcome to BYO your own tools too.

This time the workshop will be hosted by [Calliope](https://neurotoxicity.github.io/).
