Music and some open mic chats as we look back at the week and years of Sabby with members of Sabby.

# 6pm Operation NDA
Do you want to sign an NDA? It's what all the cool kids are doing.

# 8pm Filibuster!
Join the filibuster, you must talk about Sabby and you can't stop, or break the rules (as determined by the referee). If you do, the ref will send you off and the next speaker starts.

# Late The Foldening & Close
Remember the Biggest Sabby Zine Ever? We're going to fold it. We'll look back at the week, check the member numbers and... maybe then we can get some sleep.
