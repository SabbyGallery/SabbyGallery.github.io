<hr>

New York folks, on friday the 21st of February come to [Boshi's Place](https://boshis.place/) for a collaboration event with Sabby Gallery.

Boshi's Place will be showing Sabby's curation of games and zines from the melbourne indie scene, while Sabby shows Boshi's curation of games and zines from NYC (at the same time) (but in melbourne).

We may even find a beautiful portal opening between our two spaces at some point during the night...
