# Speakers
[Nique Vi](https://tritake.com/) (she/her) is a game developer based in Naarm who has spent many late nights thinking about Scout TF2’s stock loadout. When not daydreaming about perfect design decisions, Nique is a volunteer at Sabby Gallery, and divides the rest of her time between innumerous procrastination projects that will be finished in a year starting with 2.

[Kira](https://kiramakesgames.itch.io/) (she/her) is a silly little guy that isn't a guy, that sometimes makes silly little games. When Kira isn't writing a bio for her IGDAM talk, she volunteers at Sabby Gallery where she makes cool posters.
