This is a unique chance for union members and non-members to come together, connect, and learn more about how [Game Workers Australia](https://www.gameworkers.com.au/) is building solidarity and stronger networks within the game workers' community.

This year Game Workers Australia will be running a workshop covering everything you need to know about unionising your workplace and providing free food for all attendees.
