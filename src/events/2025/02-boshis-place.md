Sabby and [Boshi's Place](https://boshis.place/) are having a simultaneous cultural exchange!

Come experience works created in New York at this one-off event at Sabby! Get down to early to make use of the time zone crossover as there have been rumours of a mysterious communication device to link the two spaces...
