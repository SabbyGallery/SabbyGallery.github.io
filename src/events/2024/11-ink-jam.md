[Ink Jam](https://itch.io/jam/inkjam-2024) is back for 2024 and this year Sabby is hosting an in person venue!

Ink Jam is a game jam for making games using the [ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink) narrative scripting language created by [inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com/) and used in their games including [80 Days](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days), [Heaven's Vault](https://www.inklestudios.com/heavensvault/) and [A Highland Song](https://www.inklestudios.com/a-highland-song).

Ink has been used in local games including [Ghost Pattern's](https://ghostpattern.net/) [Wayward Strand](https://www.waywardstrand.com/) and [Cecile Richard's](https://cecilerichard.design/) [Gutless](https://dominoclub.itch.io/gutless) and international games like [Sable](https://www.shed-works.co.uk/sable) and [Goodbye Volcano High](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1310330/Goodbye_Volcano_High/).

Join us at Sabby and make a game using Ink.

If you've never used ink before, alongside the jam we are running an optional workshop to introduce attendees to ink. If you already know ink you can jump right into working on your game but for those new to ink the workshop will help you get started!
