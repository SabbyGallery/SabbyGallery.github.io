An event for performing things such as: 
    - Soliloquies
    - Aposrophes
    - Asides
    - Cartoonish villain monologues
    - comically verbose rants?

A chill night so feel free to perform whatever, Memorized, improvised or read aloud! 

We've also got some copy pastas for folks who don't know what to perform.
