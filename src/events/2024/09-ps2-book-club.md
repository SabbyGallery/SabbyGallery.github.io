This Month: Simpsons Road Rage // Ratchet and Clank 2

Ah, the Playstation 2. So many games, so few polygons, so much fun.

PS2 "Book" Club is a casual event where people come together to present PS2 games. Maybe they're an old favourite, or maybe there's just one forgotten *thing* about one that urgently *needs* to be talked about.

Hosted by the wonderful [Fraser](https://bsky.app/profile/brumley53.bsky.social).
