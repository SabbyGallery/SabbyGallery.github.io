Our good friends from Sydney's [Serenade](https://serenade.games/) are collaborating with Sabby to present their [Freeplay](https://www.freeplay.net.au/) side-show, *TANGENTS*! 

*TANGENTS* is an exhibit of weird and wonderful games from NSW, fostering connections on the fringes during [Freeplay](https://www.freeplay.net.au/) week in Melbourne.

Jae from Serenade will be talking at Freeplay on Day One. That's Thursday 6th June at 1.30PM. Their talk will be followed by our very own Null and Siobhan who will be delivering a talk about Sabby.

Don't miss that double-header, and don't miss *TANGENTS*!
