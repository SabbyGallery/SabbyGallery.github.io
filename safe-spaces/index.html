	<h1>Safe Space Policy</h1>

	<p>We want everyone to feel safe at Sabby.</p>

	<p>If you have any concerns at all about your safety or comfort and would like to discuss them before any of our events, please feel free to <a href="/contact/">get in touch with us</a>.</p>

	<p>If anyone at all is making you feel unsafe or unwelcome <i>during</i> an event, you can let any organiser at Sabby know. We will take you seriously and respond accordingly.</p>

	<p>Likewise, if you want to debrief about anything that happened at the event, we’d be grateful to hear about anything you feel we could have done better.</p>

	<ul>
	<p>We explicitly won't tolerate any of the following behaviour(s):</p>
		<li>Any language that demeans, devalues or is derogatory towards one’s race, gender, sexuality, physical appearance including body size, class, religion, language, age, ability, and/or socio-economic status.</li>
		<li>Bullying, stalking, following and other such intimidating behaviour.
		Photography or recording after someone has asked not to be photographed.</li>
		<li>Inappropriate non-consensual physical contact, or unwelcome attention of any kind.</li>
		<li>Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviours.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Failure to comply with our safe space policy will result in being banned from the event, and any future Sabby events if applicable.</p>
